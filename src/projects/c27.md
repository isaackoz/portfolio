This project was created for a startup in Newport Beach. This was my first major project that I took from an idea to production with real customers. Although the startup didn't end up succeeding due to external factors, I learned a lot in the process.

### The Idea

The idea behind this startup was to create a luxury food delivery business that was akin to DoorDash technology wise, but offered a white-glove service for high end restaurants. To achieve this, the company needed a professionaly made web application that would allow customers to register as a member, pay the monthly fees, browse available restaurants, browse available food within each restaurant, and place an order. Upon placing an order, the drivers would get a notification via Slack (hey, it worked), and they would complete the service from there.


### Tech Stack

For this project, I used the following tech stack:

**Frontend**
- Next.js for the framework.
- Clerk for authentication
- MongoDB for the database (oops)
- Vercel for deployment

**Backend**
- PayloadCMS (Express.js) for content management
- DigitalOcean droplet for deployment


### Challenges Faced

As this was my first ever project, I honestly had no clue what I was doing. I did about a week or two of research before I even began. I was not confident/skilled enough yet to run my content management system for creating restaurants, adding menu items, etc. However, I still needed a way to deeply integrate whatever CMS I decided to use into Next.js.

I found out about PayloadCMS and it seemed like a perfect match. Unfortunately, at the time PayloadCMS only supported MongoDB. So I ended up using MongoDB as the database for the entire thing. That was probably the worst mistake I made. Although PayloadCMS had generated types to catch migration changes, I quickly realized why relational databases were praised so much. Even using TypeScript, I ran into countless race conditions and bugs that I am sure I wouldn't have had if I were using a proper database. 


### Outcome

Despite these mistakes, I still managed to get everything working and delivered a successful MVP. The company loved it and it worked great for what it was. While the company was working on aquiring customers, I was in the process of migrating away from PayloadCMS and MongoDB to a proper solution. Before I was able to finish, the company went under.

This project taught me a *ton* about creating web applications, CI/CD, and dealing with customers in production. Although I walked away with barely anything, the skills I learned made this entire project more than worth it.


### Images

I don't have access to this project anymore, but here are a few screenshots I clipped from a video I found from a demo.
